Our amplifier needs to filter out the G3 note, which is 196.0 Hz

The next highest and the next lowest notes are 50 Hz apart, so our bandwidth will be 50 Hz, with a high power frequency of 221 Hz and a low power frequency of 171 Hz, with a cutoff frequency of 196 Hz.

This requires an RC of 1074.42 for the low-pass part, and an RC of 1388.58 for the high-pass part.

We also wanted a slope of -40 dB/decade after the cutoff frequencies.

Michael has a box of capacitors, so he'll bring it next time we meet to decide what our components will be.  He also has a speaker, which we will use.

We also looked at op-amps and tried to figure out what we needed.  We found LM741 op-amps on sale for $7 for 10, so we decided to buy it.

Michael was put in charge with simulating the circuit with MultiSim, since he is the most experienced with it.
